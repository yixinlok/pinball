# Pinball
This is a pinball game using C meant to be directly displayed on a VGA monitor of a ARM DE1-SoC computer. 

Press the space bar to start and the ball will directly spawn from the spawn point at the top of the screen in a random direction. The flippers are also controlled using the space bar.

Here is a demonstration on CPULator, an online ARM DE1-SoC simulator. However, note that because we are using CPULator the performance is a lot slower than on an actual DE1-SoC computer.
